# DCU-MobileRobotics
Mobile Robotics Motor Control Project
Project Overview

This project implements basic motor control for a two-wheeled mobile robot using an ESP32 microcontroller and a DRV8835 dual motor driver. The robot is programmed to move forward, stop, move backward, and stop again in a continuous loop. Speed and direction are controlled using PWM and phase pins.

The goal of this project is to establish reliable low-level motion control as a foundation for more advanced robotics behaviors such as line-following, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous navigation.
